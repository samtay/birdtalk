1. [Supabase?]()

- Can also self host on e.g.
  [digital](https://docs.digitalocean.com/developer-center/hosting-supabase-on-digitalocean/)
  [ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDhy6pk282U) ([another
  resource](https://medium.com/@kelvinpompey.me/self-hosting-supabase-on-ubuntu-and-digital-ocean-9bff8a819250)).

100. Possibly useful in the future https://docs.rs/anim/latest/anim/

### xeno-canto

Cornell said fuck me, so XC it is. There's a lot of recordings, will need to
optimize a [search](https://xeno-canto.org/help/search).

- length (maybe 6-12s)
- license:

Can even box a location and filter by a box of lat/long coordinates, however it
might make more sense to leverage Merlin or eBird to list out birds of a given
region, and then query for them specifically.

Will likely need an `xc-indexer` tool that hits their API repeatedly and builds
out a database. It will need to sleep `1s` between requests to avoid the
throttle.

For MVP, can probably just their hosted audio for now, but eventually will want to index this and store it myself, so that it is easily cropped.

### deployment

### national audubon society collection

- Waiting to hear back from [Lang](https://musicofnature.com/audubon-bird-songs/)

# game

### roadmap

- `/game` for game mode
- `/lib` or `/train` for just learning and no quizzing.
  - Maybe catalog, filterable, with "bird cards" that each have a play/pause button. (def would want preload=metadata for that).
- `/ambience` with a playlist of birds.
  - per dan: maybe option for river background and random intervals between bird calls
- Option to show picture of the bird, but no points awarded in this mode.
- Show sonogram animation
- achievements, streaks, etc.
- can I do a "tour" with context state? and once tour is marked as skipped or finished, those elements go away?
- #46764e is a great color for text

#### settings ideas

- out of 2 vs out of 4 (less points for 2)
- possibly: show img on mystery bird instead of choices (less points)
- autoplay: auto / auto after first / off
- loop: on/off

- https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.5/reference/context#using-shared-state use context for settings

### error handling

- use https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.5/cookbook/error_handling#throwing-errors
  to have an error msg section up top. or context?

### mvp todo

MVP should probably just be a game demo using local storage, no user identity, database, etc.

- game loop

  - handle game finished (all birds learned)

- animations

  - success animation: spin, green, modal with more info and nice things?
  - YO https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-based-on-sibling-state
    - it might be possible to have this be PURELY tailwind css driven! just use
      groups or peers to trigger visibility on the correct / incorrect modals (and
      hopefully CSS animations will be enough)
  - see https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/css-transitions/ for tips on
    finishing touches and leveraging GPU for smooth transitions
    and apply https://tailwindcss.com/docs/will-change

- settings

  - create a client-side settings context using local storage
  - implement game settings like confirm choice, autoplay, etc.

- remember: use ? none propagation to hide elements. also see above for error handling

- fix header

  - get the commit from the saved branch. export the header with the nice font
    from canva, resized to fit the word and with transparent background.
  - then export the birdtalk icon as SVG
    - or, export both the talk bubble and bird separately
  - then animate the bird portion of the svg with css! (could be .gif still but smaller footprint)

- add 'space' or other handler to toggle audio
  - see docsite/src/shortcuts.rs
  - and
    https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/blob/e2002d6ea42f5844a3832ab7f038620ecf977a1c/packages/desktop/src/hooks.rs#L72
    for desktop

# business

### Freemium

- Free app with 20 birds, 1 song/call each
- Additional 25-bird packs $5/each for life
- Or enchilada full North American 800+ bird pack for $100 for life
- $10/month for access to everything
- Note: for life options probably require downloading bird packs rather than streaming, to limit server costs.
- Naming: bird pack? bevy? flock?

### Cost to run

- Maybe it makes more sense to drop fullstack. Instead, just build frontend (web, mobile) and initially render with placeholders that `use_server_future()` against `supabase {pg, auth}`.

- See linode https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/
  - and digital ocean https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces
  - similar offerings, DO being .005 / GB more expensive on > 1TB transfer
  - Can I use these to just host the static site? I guess if I want "fullstack" I need to run server as well...
  - Too bad bc supabase would be free, could just hit them instead of running my own server.
- can i leverage supabase edge functions? they have to be typescript...
